**Coordinate and track changes across your software architecture.**

CodePlans is an open-source engineering planning tool that helps teams manage coordinated code changes across complex systems. It maps demand (work items: features, bugs, tech debt) onto delivery (code plans and tasks) across your architecture (products and assets), giving teams a shared view of what's changing, where, and why.

## Why CodePlans?

Modern engineering teams struggle with change coordination across distributed codebases. Tickets track individual tasks but miss the bigger picture; architecture docs go stale; migrations and refactors span multiple services with no shared source of truth.

CodePlans sits between your issue tracker and your architecture diagram:

- **Products** group your system's components under a planning boundary
- **Assets** represent individual components (apps, services, libraries, datastores, platforms) with health and tech debt tracking
- **Work Items** are the demand side — features, bugs, UX issues, and tech debt items — linked many-to-many to the plans that address them (natively, or mirrored from GitHub/GitLab)
- **Code Plans** coordinate related changes across assets with owners, assignees, deadlines, per-asset branch/PR tracking, and progress
- **Tasks** are the individual units of work tied to a plan and optionally scoped to a specific asset

## Deployment Modes

CodePlans has two independent configuration axes that control how an instance behaves.

### `HOST_MODE` — the deployment model

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `team` | Single private team. One organisation, no open registration, billing UI hidden. The right default for self-hosted installs. |
| `saas` | Multi-tenant hosted. Multiple independent orgs can exist, open registration is possible, billing UI available. |

### `REGISTRATION` — who can create accounts

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `closed` | `/signup` returns 404. Users are created by an admin via `pnpm db:seed` or a future admin CLI. |
| `invite` | `/signup` shows an invite-only message. (Token-based invite flow is planned.) |
| `open` | Anyone who can reach the server can sign up. |

### Common combinations

**Self-hosted team** (recommended default):
```bash
HOST_MODE=team
REGISTRATION=closed
```

**Hosted SaaS with open signup:**
```bash
HOST_MODE=saas
REGISTRATION=open
```

**Closed beta / waitlist:**
```bash
HOST_MODE=saas
REGISTRATION=invite
```

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm`)

### Self-hosted team (SQLite, no cloud required)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/SylonZero/CodePlans.git
cd CodePlans

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# .env.example defaults to HOST_MODE=team, REGISTRATION=closed, SQLite — no changes needed

# 4. Run migrations and create the admin account
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed

# 5. Start the dev server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign in with:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Email | `admin@example.com` |
| Password | `Password1!` |

Change your password in **Settings → Security** after first login.

> **Want realistic demo data?** Run `pnpm db:seed-demo` after `pnpm db:seed` to populate the workspace with products, assets, plans, and tasks. All demo accounts use password `Password1!` — see [Demo accounts](#demo-accounts) below.

> **Deploying to a server?** Set `AUTH_URL=https://your-server-domain` (or `http://ip:port`) in `.env.local`. Auth.js requires this in production to construct correct callback URLs — without it, login redirects will fail.  
> If running the dev server on a remote machine, also set `ALLOWED_DEV_ORIGINS=your.server.ip`.

### Cloud (Supabase + Postgres) mode

```bash
# Set these variables in .env.local
HOST_MODE=saas
REGISTRATION=open
AUTH_PROVIDER=supabase
DB_PROVIDER=postgres
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-publishable-key
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

Then run `pnpm db:migrate` and `pnpm dev`.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3000` | Port the dev server binds to |
| `HOST_MODE` | `saas` | `team` (private self-hosted) or `saas` (multi-tenant hosted) |
| `REGISTRATION` | `open` | `closed`, `invite`, or `open` — controls who can create accounts |
| `AUTH_PROVIDER` | `local` | `local` (bcrypt + session cookie) or `supabase` |
| `DB_PROVIDER` | `sqlite` | `sqlite` or `postgres` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `:memory:` | SQLite: `file:data/codeplans.db` or `:memory:`. Postgres: full connection string |
| `DB_SSL` | `true` | Set `false` for local or non-SSL Postgres |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | — | Secret for local auth session signing (min 32 chars) |
| *(integration tokens)* | — | Paste tokens directly on connections (stored AES-256-GCM-encrypted with a key derived from `AUTH_SECRET`), or reference a server env var by name for secrets-in-deployment postures |
| `AUTH_URL` | — | **Required in production.** Full URL of the server (e.g. `https://codeplans.yourteam.com`). Auth.js uses this to construct callback URLs and validate login redirects. Not needed for `localhost` dev. |
| `BILLING_ENABLED` | `true` | Set `false` to hide billing UI (always off in `team` mode) |
| `ALLOWED_DEV_ORIGINS` | — | Comma-separated hosts allowed to access Next.js dev resources (needed when running on a remote server) |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | — | Resend API key for transactional email (email change verification, future invites). Without this, verification URLs are logged to the server console (dev only). |
| `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` | `CodePlans <noreply@codeplans.ai>` | From address used in outgoing emails |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | — | Required for Supabase auth mode |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | — | Required for Supabase auth mode |
| `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` | — | Required for Supabase auth mode (server-side) |

## Database Schema

The core data model:

```
users
  └── organizationMembers ──→ organizations
        └── products
              ├── assets
              │     └── assetDependencies
              └── codePlans
                    └── tasks
```

Both SQLite and Postgres schemas are maintained in parallel under `lib/db/`. Migrations live in `lib/db/migrations/{sqlite,postgres}/`.

---

## Running Tests

```bash
pnpm test              # run all tests (88 tests across 3 files)
pnpm test:watch        # watch mode
pnpm test:coverage     # with coverage report
```

Tests use an in-memory SQLite database and run in isolated forked processes.

---

## Database Scripts

```bash
pnpm db:generate       # generate migrations from schema changes
pnpm db:migrate        # apply migrations
pnpm db:push           # push schema directly (dev only)
pnpm db:studio         # open Drizzle Studio
pnpm db:seed           # create admin account + default workspace
pnpm db:seed-demo      # populate with realistic multi-user demo data
```

The seed scripts respect three optional env vars for the admin account:

```bash
SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com   # default
SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD=Password1!       # default
SEED_ADMIN_NAME=Admin                # default
SEED_ORG_NAME="My Workspace"         # default
```

---

## Demo accounts

After running `pnpm db:seed-demo`, five accounts are available:

| Name | Email | Role | Password |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alex Chen | `alex.chen@codeplans.local` | Owner | `Password1!` |
| Sarah Kim | `sarah.kim@codeplans.local` | Admin | `Password1!` |
| Mike Jones | `mike.jones@codeplans.local` | Editor | `Password1!` |
| Lisa Wang | `lisa.wang@codeplans.local` | Editor | `Password1!` |
| James Lee | `james.lee@codeplans.local` | Viewer | `Password1!` |

The demo workspace includes 3 products, 15 assets, 9 code plans, and ~65 tasks across various stages.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. To get started:

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch
2. Make your changes — the SQLite local mode requires no cloud setup
3. Add or update tests in `tests/`
4. Open a pull request with a clear description

Please keep PRs focused. Bug fixes, test coverage improvements, and documentation updates are especially appreciated.

---

## Design Specs

Specs live in git (`docs/specs/*.md` by convention), not in CodePlans. Link a spec's blob URL to any plan or work item via the **Spec URL** field: plan pages render the markdown read-only (private repos render through your GitHub/GitLab connection tokens; anything else is a link-out). See the [specs guide](https://sylonzero.github.io/CodePlans/guides/using-specs.md), and the [monorepo modeling guide](https://sylonzero.github.io/CodePlans/guides/modeling-monorepos.md) for breaking large codebases into assets (Claude can do it for you via MCP).

---

## Connect Claude (MCP)

CodePlans ships an MCP server at `/api/mcp/mcp` (Streamable HTTP). Create an API key in **Settings → API Keys**, then:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http codeplans http://localhost:3000/api/mcp/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer cpk_your_key"
```

Claude can then read plans/work items/tech debt and (with a write-scope key) model products, assets, and dependencies, manage plans end-to-end (create, target assets, activate/complete), file work items, manage tasks, and record branch/PR status on plan assets. Keys act as your user, so org access rules and mirrored-field protections apply unchanged. See [`docs/specs/mcp-server-spec.md`](docs/specs/mcp-server-spec.md).
